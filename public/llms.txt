## About Argus AI

Argus AI is a real-time traffic intelligence platform developed by Traffic Data Group, Inc. We provide sub-10-second incident detection through AI-powered multi-source data aggregation.

## What We Do

Argus AI aggregates traffic data from 5 key sources:
1. 911/PSAP dispatch data - human-verified emergency incidents
2. Telematics and connected vehicle data - hard brake events, speed anomalies
3. Roadway sensors - loop detectors, radar, lidar on highways
4. Traffic camera AI - computer vision on DOT camera networks
5. Dashcam video inference - mobile coverage from fleet vehicles

## Key Differentiator

Sub-10-second incident detection latency. Traditional traffic data takes 3-5 minutes to detect incidents. Argus AI detects in under 10 seconds using camera and dashcam AI inference.

## Who We Serve

- Navigation and routing application developers
- Fleet management and logistics companies
- Ride-sharing and mobility platforms
- Food delivery and last-mile logistics
- Insurance and risk assessment (InsurTech)
- State DOTs and transportation agencies
- 911 PSAPs and emergency services

## API Access

Developers can integrate Argus AI traffic intelligence via REST API:
- Real-time incident feeds (WebSocket and REST)
- Historical traffic data queries
- Speed and flow data by road segment
- Coverage across the United States
